# old-python-projects
My old python projects.

1_first_project - user inputs their name, then the program greets the user.
2_age_calculator - calculates the age of a person using inputted start and end dates.
3_pangram_game (requires "pip install pyenchant") - user tries to guess the shortest pangram, or sentence containing at least one of every letter.
4_typing_test - Gives the user a long passage to type. Allows them to type 'stop' as their last word if they don't want to type the whole passage. After pressing enter, the program tells the user the elapsed time and accuracy.
5_hangman_game - it's just a hangman game. *NEVER GOT FINISHED. WON'T RUN.*
